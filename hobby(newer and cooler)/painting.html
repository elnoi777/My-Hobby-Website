                <p id="ffp">Paint colors have a notable effect on the human body because they are said to vibrate at the same frequency. For example, red can cause the heart to beat faster and blue can slow the heart down.</p>

                <h3 id="ffh3">Fun Fact</h3>
                <p id="ffp">Paint blends better when it is wet. Therefore it is better to paint a wall as you move in one direction rather than rolling the edges first. Once paint dries, the paint applied to the edges to blend them will simply become a second coat rather than blending. This can cause dark spots.</p>
